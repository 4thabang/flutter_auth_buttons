## Usage

Add `flutter_auth_buttons` to your `pubspec.yaml`, then import the Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_auth_buttons/flutter_auth_buttons.dart';
```

Use the `onPressed` attribute to capture the button press and call your authentication logic within that. To disable
the button, pass `null` or omit the attribute.

```dart
FacebookSignInButton(onPressed: () {
  // call authentication logic
});
```

Some buttons have a dark mode. Enable this with the optional parameter:

```dart
GoogleSignInButton(
  onPressed: () {/* ... */}, 
  darkMode: true, // default: false
)
```

You can adjust the border-radius of the buttons:

```dart
TwitterSignInButton(
  onPressed: () {},
  borderRadius: 10.0,
)
```

See the documentation for API details: https://pub.dartlang.org/documentation/flutter_auth_buttons/latest/.
